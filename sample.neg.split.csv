"18340"," 1","Look, I've practically lost all hope in Nickelodeon after watching their newest \hit,\"" The Naked Brothers Band show, and \""ICarly\"" is no exception"
"18340"," 2","If you haven't noticed, ICarly is now the #1 hit tween sitcom on television right now"
"18340"," 3","After hearing this, I decided to watch a few episodes myself to see what the hype was about"
"18340"," 4","I have one word to describe this show in general"
"18340"," 5","\""EFFORTLESS"
"18340"," 6","\"" I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT DAN SCHNEIDER WOULD GO THIS LOW AND MAKE SOMETHING THIS CRAPPY"
"18340"," 7","IT'S HORRIBLE"
"18340"," 8","Let me give you the details"
"18340"," 9","<br /><br />The ICarly cast starts out with a girl by the name of Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove"
"18340","10","Carly, unfortunately throughout the episodes, doesn't really have a personality so to speak of"
"18340","11","I guess she's supposed to be the average girl in the show"
"18340","12","(because a LOT of people have an Army veteran for a dad, an artist for a brother, and a popular teen web show taped and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment"
"18340","13",") and to say the most about Miranda, HER ACTING IS PATHETIC"
"18340","14","She sounds like a 3 year old girl with Tourette's syndrome on a sugar-high half the time"
"18340","15","<br /><br />Next, we have Sam Puckett(good GOD where do they get these names"
"18340","16",") played by Jennette McCurdy"
"18340","17","Sam is the \""CO-HOST\"" of Carly's web show"
"18340","18","(Wait a minute, if Sam hosts the show with Carly, shouldn't the show be called \""ICarly and Sam"
"18340","19","\"" I bet Sam feels like she's been ripped off"
"18340","20",")Sam is supposed to be the bully in the cast"
"18340","21","(Yeah, because EVERY girl bully wears girly skin-tight shirts and pants with blonde hair extentions"
"18340","22",") She also, I think, is supposed to be a Tomboy, too"
"18340","23","I would find this a little funny, but it's her Cliché PUNS THAT RUIN IT"
"18340","24","The \""Give me a bucket of fried chicken\"" pun is overused WAY TOO MUCH"
"18340","25","GIVE THIS GIRL A SCRIPT"
"18340","26","and GIVE HER A COFFEE because, don't get me wrong Jennette's acting is okay, but, throughout half the episodes, she looks like she's about ready to fall asleep"
"18340","27","<br /><br />Next we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress"
"18340","28","Freddie is the technical producer for Carly and Sam's show"
"18340","29","There's not much to say about Freddie other than the fact that he's a techno geek and has a crush on Carly, which never works out"
"18340","30","HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE Clichés"
"18340","31","DOES IT NOT STOP"
"18340","32","Nathan's acting is also okay, but seems to get excessive sometimes"
"18340","33","HE'S TOO BORING"
"18340","34","<br /><br />Lastly, and my most favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor"
"18340","35","Let me make this perfectly clear; IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM, THIS DIRT CLUSTER OF A SHOW WOULD BE MUD"
"18340","36","Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive"
"18340","37","Spencer is the older brother of Carly"
"18340","38","If you had a little 5 year old who was both on a Caffeine high and constipated, you would have this character summed up"
"18340","39","Spencer also earns money from being an artist"
"18340","40","(hmmm"
"18340","41","I wonder"
"18340","42",") You would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures"
"18340","43","yeah, I just love sarcasm"
"18340","44","HIS ART IS PRETTY MUCH UTTER CRAP"
"18340","45","I mean, what kind of sculpture name is \""MERRY SNIFFMUS"
"18340","46","\"" WHAT"
"18340","47","THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH CREATIVITY AS A HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH ON DRUGS"
"18340","48","IT'S STUPID"
"18340","49","<br /><br />THE PLOT SETTINGS AND MORALS ARE EFFORTLESS BAGS OF POOP"
"18340","50","These shows are now telling kids that stealing, lying, and being an asshole to your parents is a GOOD THING"
"18340","51","IF THESE ARE THE KINDS OF AWFUL CRAPPY SHOWS THAT THEY'RE THROWING AT KIDS THESE DAYS, THEN I DON'T WANT TO TAKE PART IN WATCHING ANY OF THEM"
"18340","52","THIS IS BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP I'VE EVER WATCHED ON TV"
"18340","53","BAR NONE"
"18340","54","NICKELODEON, \""I'M THROUGH WITH YOU"
"18340","55","\"" END OF STORY"
"18340","56","1/10"""
"12796"," 1","Yes, we all know about Dan Schneider's odd little fascination with making shows with young kids and iCarly is no exception"
"12796"," 2","See young girls wiggle their toes and stick their tongues out for the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikini's"
"12796"," 3","Yes, it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd"
"12796"," 4","Either way the show isn't that good when compared to Dan Schneiders other shows like the far superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh"
"12796"," 5","<br /><br />The show is about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) living alone and having to get by on their own while their father is off in the Army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives"
"12796"," 6","Carly has a mean spirited friend named Sam and they do a very well produced, award winning web show called iCarly with their little school friend Freddie"
"12796"," 7","The episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx at school"
"12796"," 8","<br /><br />Carly Shay is a young, all knowing web personality/ business woman/ producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who relies on talking very very loudly and fast to get her point across and making odd faces"
"12796"," 9","Her brother Spencer is a somewhat mean-spirited, dim-wit and eccentric artist played by Jerry Trainor, who tries a bit to hard to be like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who'd like this type of Joey Gladstone humor"
"12796","10","Then there's Sam Puckett, an unlikable, mean little, lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy who clearly wears hair extensions as you can see them disappear then reappear from scene to scene"
"12796","11","And finally there's Freddie Benson the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical adviser, who has a major crush on Carly but will obviously get nowhere with her who's played by Nathan Kress"
"12796","12","<br /><br />Other secondary characters come and go such as Freddies mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round out the cast"
"12796","13","Most of the comedy is mean spirited, like blowing up Lewbert the Doorman as a gag, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl scouts selling cookies"
"12796","14","All of the adults come off as complete idiots while the children are all knowing, and certain main characters have absolutely no morals"
"12796","15","Lying, cheating, stealing and violence all are acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, Yes"
"12796","16","it's a children's show"
"12796","17","What more could the young viewers ask for"
"12796","18","Well, with Dan Schneider we can expect to have the young girls dress in tight clothes and bikini's and do some odd things like sticking their tongues out for the camera and eating banana's"
"12796","19","<br /><br />Shows like this are just what the young crowd likes though and I guess no worse then any of the other garbage Nick shovels at its young crowd"
"12796","20","There's always fans to be found for anything seen on TV, at least this is a bit better then most of the stuff seen on Nick like that horrible Naked Brothers show"
"18935"," 1","I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews"
"18935"," 2","The script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too"
"18935"," 3","The director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense"
"18935"," 4","It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller"
"18935"," 5","Therefore I had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me"
"18935"," 6","I was always asking what kind of movie I am watching"
"18935"," 7","Then I didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry"
"18935"," 8","The end is also very disappointing"
"18935"," 9","I cannot understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in this worst role of her life"
"18935","10","Jodie, therefore I liked very much PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN"
"18935","11","This is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen"
"18935","12","4/10"
" 3243"," 1","Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies"
" 3243"," 2","Joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody"
" 3243"," 3","He takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from Tango & Cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from Future War"
" 3243"," 4","Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions Led Zeppelin"
" 3243"," 5","Well, the car crashes and the chase is on"
" 3243"," 6","The lucky kids to escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield"
" 3243"," 7","They're chased around town, break things and Tonya gets leered at by her mom while she's undressing for a bath"
" 3243"," 8","The action winds up at a hospital where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away"
" 3243"," 9","In the end, some green lights flash, Joe shouts and Puffy vanishes without a trace"
" 3243","10","Wish I could say the same for this movie"
" 3243","11","Watch it from the relative safety of MST"
"47163"," 1","My first full Heston movie"
"47163"," 2","The movie that everyone already knows the ending to"
"47163"," 3","A \Sci Fi Thriller\"""
"47163"," 4","The campy factor"
"47163"," 5","Everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when I rented it, and on the morning that I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that I was in (Not wanting to move"
"47163"," 6","Put in player, hide in blankets)"
"47163"," 7","And though I tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture, it just really didn't make it"
"47163"," 8","Everything was all over the place, relationships had no backbone, the ending had no lead in"
"47163"," 9","Everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to, because even though we all know that it's people, it's quick answers as to WHY it's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window"
