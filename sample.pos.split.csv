"22477"," 1","The best screen performance ever by George C"
"22477"," 2","Scott"
"22477"," 3","The screenplay by Chayefsky, the irony-freighted dialogue, is near perfect ('Just where do you train your nurses, Dachau"
"22477"," 4","')"
"22477"," 5","Rigg is wonderful as the rescuing angel who saves Scott from doom, as is the whole cast"
"22477"," 6","It's a hilarious and serious movie"
"22477"," 7","It is a movie of the period, the 60's, but it is not in any sense dated"
"22477"," 8","What it is about, the chaos and irrationality of the system vs"
"22477"," 9","the sanity of the individual, is timeless"
"22477","10","And the \We heal nothing"
"22477","11","We cure nothing\"" monologue (delivered, shouted actually, as no one else but Scott could) with its references to cloning and other 'wonders' of modern science could literally have been written this morning"
"22477","12","<br /><br />"""
"17433"," 1","I saw the movie at the Nashville film festival on May 1, 2003"
"17433"," 2","It was amazing"
"17433"," 3","All the things that I had read about Stuey were portrayed incredibly well by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible job as Stuey), and all the others involved in this"
"17433"," 4","I'm glad he (Vidmer) didn't go down the \Leaving Las Vegas\"" routine with Stuey's bad habits, but instead put us inside his life, family, and his gift"
"17433"," 5","Tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill"
"17433"," 6","A big \""thumbs up\"" on this one"
"17433"," 7",""""
"17182"," 1","Non-stop action and just about every conceivable (and inconceivable"
"17182"," 2",") sci-fi/horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun, big-budget epic"
"17182"," 3","The pace never lets up, especially in the shorter US version, which tightens things up considerably"
"28158"," 1","Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing"
"28158"," 2","It has officially become my new favourite movie"
"28158"," 3","<br /><br />I don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before"
"28158"," 4","I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy"
"28158"," 5","Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters"
"28158"," 6","This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked"
"28158"," 7","All of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and lovable script"
"28158"," 8","<br /><br />The charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles"
"28158"," 9","Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be"
"28158","10","<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree"
"28158","11","Everyone I've recommended this film to has loved it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful"
"28158","12","<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy"
"35918"," 1","The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty good replacement duo"
